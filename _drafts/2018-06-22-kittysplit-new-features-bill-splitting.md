title: How to share expenses and split costs using an Excel Spreadsheet
---

There are some hard things in life and keeping track of who paid what in a group
definitely belongs on that list. Say you're going on a trip with friends and

to a refund. At the end of the day it's a big hassle to work out who owes money
to whom and to get everyone to settle up.
