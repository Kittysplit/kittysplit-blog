title: Multiple currencies in one Kitty
---

We've just launched a great new feature.

You know the feeling when someone's telling a story about a foreign trip and then they mention the cost of something in a foreign currency? "Can you believe that a sandwich costs 23 doubloons over there!" and then they expect you to not only know the exchange rate but to do the conversion in your head. We find it annoying when that happens and sadly it's a problem that our new feature doesn't solve.

## Euros, Pounds, Yen, Doubloons, BitCoin

Instead, this new feature will make it much simpler to go on these types of international trips and track everything in Kittysplit. Because now you can enter expenses in any currency you want and we'll convert it back to your "home" currency. It really is that simple.

In the background of course, things are slightly more complex. We fetch the exchange rates from XXX and then do XXX. Like all other features we designed this to be as simple as possible without any complex configuration. This means you can't do anything fancy with the currency conversion.

## More goodies are on the way! üéÅ

We are currently working on a bunch of other things that we‚Äôll be launching within the next few months. Do give us feedback and let us know what you think.
