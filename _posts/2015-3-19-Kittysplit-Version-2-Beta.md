title: Beta version of the all new Kittysplit
---
There is so much goodness in the new version of Kittysplit, that we don't actually know where to begin. It's been completely rewritten from scratch and after vigorous testing we're now confident that it can be slowly exposed to the light of the real world. You can try it [here right now](http://beta.kittysplit.com/new)

## New coat of paint

The thing you'll probably notice first is that we have a new logo. We think it's marvelous and hope that you do too. Thanks [Nora](http://norakuper.de/)!

To go with the logo we also have a new look. Note that we may tweak this a little more before we release the final version, and indeed after we launch the final version, because we can.

## New features

Onto the beef. 

There are a bunch of new features, and more are coming soon. Here are the most important ones:

1. Kittysplit is now available in German. Now that we've introduced one new language, adding further ones is going to be much easier. Next up: french. After that? Who knows.
2. You can now add incoming expenses to a kitty, for example when a deposit is returned.
3. Some basic stats are provided per kitty. You can see how the group spent in total, how much you spent and what your total share is.
4. Debts can now be marked as settled. Lots of our faithful users had asked for this feature.

## New tech
However, we haven't just polished the surface. Kittysplit is now implemented using some very shiny new technology: [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/). We're also no longer running on Google App engine. However, we'll expand on this in a later post.

## Can I use the new beta?
Yes! Your data will be safe. Once the new beta version transitions to the default version your kitties will be right there.

## What about my old kitties?
Your kitties will stay on the "old" kittysplit. We're not going to move them over, because it would be a lorry-load of work that'd rather invest in other cool things. Don't worry, they'll continue to work and you can carry on adding expenses as before. They will continue to work for at least a year.

You should try new Kittysplit [right now](http://beta.kittysplit.com/new). Please leave us feedback in the comments below.

So long,
Kittysplit.
