title: Kittysplit announces seed funding
---
Erdem Cakmak, a first-time investor, is funding Kittysplit.

_I used Kittysplit for the first time during a holiday in Anatolia_, says Cakmak. _It immediately struck me as being very elegant and solved a real problem. So today, I am very pleased to announce that I have become a seed investor in Kittysplit_.

## Shareholder Value
The Kittysplit steering comittee released this short statement: _Mr Cakmak's investment proves that we are interactively productizing maintainable products. Going forward we intend to dynamically orchestrate empowered process improvements. In the medium term our aim is crystal clear: to fungibly facilitate cross functional e-commerce._

## Holistic synergies
_I met up with the team and really liked them_, Cakmak reveals. _Those guys work really hard._

_With the investment I have made in the company, they'll be able to drink that weird yellow fizzy stuff they like for at least another three days. One of them could also really do with a new T-Shirt. Maybe they'll use it for that._

Mr Cakmak owns a Kebab shop near the GÃ¶rlitzer Bahnhof in Berlin.
