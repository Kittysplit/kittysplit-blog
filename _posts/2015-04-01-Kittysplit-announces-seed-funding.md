---
Erdem Cakmak, a first-time investor, is funding Kittysplit.

"I used Kittysplit for the first time during a holiday in Anatolia", says Cakmak. "It immediately struck me as being very elegant and solved a real problem. So today, I am very pleased to announce that I have become a seed investor in Kittysplit".

## Holistic synergies
"I met up with the team and really liked them", Cakmak reveals. "Those guys work really hard."

He went on: "With the investment I have made in the company, they'll be able to drink that weird yellow fizzy stuff they like for at least another three days. One of them could also really do with a new T-Shirt. Maybe they'll use it for that."

Mr Cakmak owns a Kebab shop near the GÃ¶rlitzer Bahnhof in Berlin.

## Shareholder Value
