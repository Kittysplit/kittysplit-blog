---
This is just a quick note to say that we did it!

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015-05-launch.png)

We launched the new version of Kittysplit. The old version, for nostalgia friends, is still online [here](http://old.kittysplit.com/new). Your old kitties will continue to work exactly as before.

## New Features

Here's a quick reminder about what's new (we covered it in more detail in our [post announcing the beta](/blog/Kittysplit-Version-2-Beta/)).

1. New design and logo
2. Kittysplit is now available in German. More languages will follow soon.
3. You can now add incoming expenses to a kitty. 
3. Some basic stats are provided per kitty. 
4. Debts can now be marked as settled.
5. Kittysplit is no longer hosted on Google App Engine, instead we are running on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=b300ef2a9cbc) using Phoenix on Elixir.
5. Massive speed and security improvements.
6. Much much [more cowbell](https://vimeo.com/55624839).

Any questions, we're right here for you.

So long,
Kittysplit.
