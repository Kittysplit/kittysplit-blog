Good news everyone! We recently added some new features to make sharing costs
 in a group even easier. This is all part of our ongoing push to become the best and easiest bill-splitting solution on the planet and beyond. And you know what? We are already half-way there.

## Add comments to a kitty

Everyone can now add comments to allow communication within Kittysplit.
This is useful if you want to add payment information for settling up at the
end of your event.

It's a feature that many of you have been asking for and we've finally delivered. âœ…

## Split expenses by weights

At the end of last year we gave you the option of [splitting costs "unequally"](/unequal-split).
This means you can add expenses where the cost is not equally shouldered by all the participants. For instance, if you shared an AirBnB but not everyone was there for the same length of time.

When we launched this feature, you could split a cost by percentage. After much feedback and testing,
we found out that splitting by weight is actually much better. This way, you don't have to do any calculations to get the percentages: in the example with AirBnB, you can simply enter the nights stayed by each party, and Kittysplit will do the rest ðŸŽ©!

## Make the costs of the event clearer

We made changes to the text of the overview: you can now see how much the event
cost the group (so far) and how much it cost the "logged in" user. We didn't think
it would be that easy either.

## Stay tuned for more!

We are currently working on a bunch of other things that weâ€™ll be launching within the next few months. Do give us feedback and let us know what you think.
