There are some hard things in life -- and keeping track of expenses in a group
definitely belongs on that list.

Say you're going on a trip with friends and
different people pay different expenses, lend money, maybe even receive money due
to a refund. At the end of the day it's a big hassle to work out who owes money
to whom and to get everyone to settle up. How to split those expenses and costs?

The problem is so common that there are many different ways of solving it. Of course,
an Excel spreadsheet or Google sheets are an absolutely valid solution. Read on
for the 2 best spreadsheets we found for solving the problem.

## How about using a mobile app or a web-app?

Naturally, because there's an app for everything, there's also an app for splitting
bills, expenses and costs. In fact there are hundreds! What are the disadvantages for using these apps?
   * everyone needs to sign up for the service
   * everyone needs to install the app
   * figuring out how it works is hard
   * Sharing the results with everyone in the group is a hassle

It sounds like itâ€™s just easier to write it all down and sort it out later with
a spreadsheet, right?

Well .... maybe. There are people out there who are so familiar with Excel or Google Sheets that
working it out with one of the two is absolutely the best option. However, before
we reveal which spreadsheet solutions we found best, we'd like to examine some of
the disadvantages given above.

There is one solution that has none of these disadvantages and guess what... it's the
one we made! [Kittysplit](https://kittysplit.com) ...
   * does not require a sign-up. No passwords and no usernames. You can start using
   it right away.
   * does not require you to download an app. It works in a browser and is
   optimised for mobile use.
   * is not hard to use. We have heard many times how easy it is to use. And
   that's the truth!
   * is very easy to share with other people.

So why not give it a try?
